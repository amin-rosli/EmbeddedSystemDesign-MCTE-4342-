# Power Saving Methods

Multiple methods was used to take to gauge differing methods and its affects on the power consumption of an Arduino Mega. Measurements of the battery voltage was taken to calculate the power consumption used by the Arduino Mega.

## Battery Voltage

The battery voltage measured is 4.71 V

## Arduino Mega default power consumption

The default current draw of the Arduino Mega was taken with a current draw of 36.5mA. 
The power consumption is 4.71V x 36.5mA = 0.172W.
