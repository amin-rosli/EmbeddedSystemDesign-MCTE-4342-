# Bluetooth buzzer

Using a HC-05 bluetooth module, the Arduino uno is then paired to a smartphone. The smartphone transmit either serial '1' or '0' to turn on or off the built-in buzzer in the Arduino.

A voltage divder was constructed to lower the voltage from the Arduino from 5v to 3.3v as rated for the HC-05 bluetooth module.
