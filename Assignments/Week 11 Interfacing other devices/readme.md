# Bluetooth buzzer

Using a HC-05 bluetooth module, the Arduino uno is then paired to a smartphone. The smartphone transmit either serial '1' or '0' to turn on or off the built-in buzzer in the Arduino.

A voltage divder was constructed to lower the voltage from the Arduino from 5v to 3.3v as rated for the HC-05 bluetooth module.

# Internet of things ( WIFI communication )

Using a ESP-32, we demonstrate the use of WIFI communication using Blynk, an internet of things platform which allows us to transmit and receive communication between 2 devices using an internet connection. In this program we use the Blynk IoT app to turn on and off an LED and also read the value of the switch to be transmitted back to Blynk through WIFI. 

Internet of Things have many applications and allows us to remotely monitor and receive information from anywhere as long as there is an internet connection.
