# Random_mode
Program using a linear actuator - developed for project.

The program generates a random distance for the linear actuator to move left and right. It was proposed to be used in our project but was later scraped due to the slow motion of the linear actuator making little difference when compared to a normal linear loop.

# DC Motor Speed and direction

Program that controls the speed of a DC motor and its direction.

Speed : A potentiometer receives input from the 10-bit analog pin and converts it into an 8-bit PWM signal to be sent to the L298N motor driver to control the speed of the motor.

Direction : 2 Buttons controls the direction of the DC motor being clockwise or anti-clockwise. The button receives the input and sends the appropriate signal to the L298N motor driver to change the direction of current flow in the DC motor.
